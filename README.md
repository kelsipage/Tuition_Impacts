Exploring the impacts that cyber and charter school tuition has on public school districts in Pennsylvania.

## Project Overview

There is a lot of discussion on the impacts that charter school per student tuition rates have had on public school districts. Organizations and impacted school districts have been working together to make adjustments to this formula to create a more equitable tuition rate that would benefit all students in Pennsylvania. These data explore the specific financial impacts that cyber charter school tution rates have had on public school districts in Pennsylvania during the 2022-2023 school year.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

I collected raw data from the Pennsylvania Department of Education website. I wanted to identify what percentage of district budgets were designated for cyber charter school tuition. I created a helper table combining these data from two data sets (tuition) and created a table to visualize the school districts that paid higher vs lower percentages (public school expenses for cyber tuition.xlsx).
