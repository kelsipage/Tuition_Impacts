Exploring the impacts that cyber and charter school tuition has on public school districts in Pennsylvania.

## Project Overview

There is a lot of discussion on the impacts that charter school per student tuition rates have had on public school districts. Organizations and impacted school districts have been working together to make adjustments to this formula to create a more equitable tuition rate that would benefit all students in Pennsylvania. These data explore the specific financial impacts that cyber charter school tution rates have had on public school districts in Pennsylvania during the 2022-2023 school year.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

I collected raw data from the Pennsylvania Department of Education website. I wanted to identify what percentage of district budgets were designated for cyber charter school tuition. I created a helper table combining these data from two data sets (tuition) and created a table to visualize the school districts that paid higher vs lower percentages (public school expenses for cyber tuition.xlsx).

## SQL

I imported all of the raw data and EDAs to SQL to dig deeper into the impacts of cyber charter school tuition on public school districts. I identified some remaining questions I had, particularly what populations of people are most affected by these tuition rates. I found additional data on the PA Department of Education website on the racial make up of the states districts. I also found data identifying which counties are designated rural and urban. I was really hoping to find data also identifying suburban school districts, but I was unable to at this time. I also wanted to look at the impacts of cyber funding on special education students, both enrolled in cyber charter schools and the funding for public school districts but I was unable to find the data that I needed.
